## Text marks
To italicize text, add one asterisk or underscore before and after a word or phrase. To italicize the middle of a word for emphasis, add one asterisk without spaces around the letters. 

Example: 
- Italicized text is the *cat's meow*.
- Italicized text is the _cat's meow_.

To bold text, add two asterisks or underscores before and after a word or phrase. To bold the middle of a word for emphasis, add two asterisks without spaces around the letters.

Example: 
- I just love **bold text**
- I just love __bold text__

To emphasize text with bold and italics at the same time, add three asterisks or underscores before and after a word or phrase. To bold and italicize the middle of a word for emphasis, add three asterisks without spaces around the letters.

Example:
- This text is __*really important*__
- This text is **_really important_**
